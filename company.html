		  			<p>Credibly is an emerging Fintech platform, leveraging <a href="/data-science-and-technology/">Data Science and technology</a> with an energetic focus on the customer experience. We created our unique lending and capital platform in order to serve small and medium-sized businesses as a trusted and committed partner.</p>

					<p>Since 2010, we&#39;ve been working with businesses to help them secure financing and working capital solutions so they can thrive. But we don&#39;t just focus on funding&mdash;we also focus on the experience. The economic reality for banks is that they cannot focus on growth stage or smaller businesses, as it costs banks the same amount of time and resources to process a $50,000 loan as a $1,000,000 loan. Other companies are purely automated and it can be nearly impossible to speak to an actual person. We pay close attention to our customers to make sure they get the dedication and personalized service they deserve. Credibly is here to help.</p>

					<p>Credibly was founded as RetailCapital in December 2010 by Ryan Rosett and Edan King, and began operating as a joint venture with Troy, Michigan-based Crestmark Bank in 2011. In 2013, the company released its first Scoring Model, which evaluates a business&#39;s overall health, beyond traditional metrics like credit score.</p>

					<p>2014 was a breakout year for RetailCapital, as it was named the 35th fastest-growing privately owned business on the prestigious Inc. 500 list. In August 2014, the company <a href="http://flexpointford.com/news/retailcapital-secures-investment-flexpoint-ford-introduces-new-ceo-35-ranking-inc-5005000/" target="_blank">secured a strategic equity investment from Flexpoint Ford</a> to accelerate its growth and trajectory, and former CAN Capital CEO Glenn Goldman joined as its new CEO. Other positive changes followed: RetailCapital opened its New York City offices, expanded its data science, risk analytics, technology, and marketing departments, and acquired 100% ownership of its joint venture structure from Crestmark Bank.</p>

					<p>In June 2015, RetailCapital officially re-branded as <strong>Credibly</strong>, to reflect a growing small business customer base that extended well beyond the retail industry. Credibly entered into an agreement with WebBank to facilitate the launch of its <a href="/business-loans/">Small Business Loan</a> product, entered into its first large bank facility with Alostar Bank of Commerce and CapitalSource, and released version 2.0 of its game-changing Scoring Model.</p>

					<p>In August 2015, Credibly <a href="http://www.inc.com/profile/credibly" target="_blank">made the Inc. 500 list for the second year in a row</a>, at #306&mdash;an accomplishment that speaks to the company&#39;s continued growth as a leader in the alternative funding space.</p>
